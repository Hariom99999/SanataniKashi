                    <p>Kashi is more than just a destination to visit; it is a way of life that can be experienced and through which you can grow as a person. It is extremely popular among Hindus because it is believed to be one of the abodes of lord Shiva.
                        Apart from this,  kashi has been a home to numerous religion and harbours variety of culture and tradition, it reflects a distinct way of life that is rich in old charm and antiquity whilst incorporating modern conveniences. Varanasi awakens to the sound of cymbals, bells, and hymns sung in the temples, and a walk along the ghats. The streets are live with vendors selling their goods, cows, birds and other animals going on about their life as usual and vehicles making way through the traffic.
                        Kashi has a rich past which is still alive in the form of its arts, music, painting, and religious ceremonies regardless of the global modernaisation.
                        Roaming the alley ways of Kashi you can get a glimpse of what hinduism truly means and how it affects life.
                        From life till death kashi is the only way to live.

                    <p>RUDRA is another name given to our Bhole Nath; this name signifies the destructive power held by lord Shiva. Rudra tandav and Lord Rudra signifies the most furious form of lord Shiva. <br>
                        The Rudraabhishek is one of the most spiritual rituals performed to please the Lord; the Rudrabhishek begins with Ganesh & Ambika Devi Puja, followed by chanting of Vedic mantras and the sacred bath of the lord in the form of Shiva lingam. The ritual requires Gangajal (water from the Ganges), flowers, incense sticks, and depending on the performers wishes one uses – milk, honey, ghee, or curd and so on for the sacred bath. At the end an aarti using 108 diyas (small earthen lamps) or as per the performers ability is performed, which is followed by distribution of offerings (Prasad). <br>
                        The benefit of such ritual is - it removes negative energy, eliminates bad Karma, protects from evils and brings harmony and peace. <br>
                        Abhishek using Dudh (milk) bring longevity, Shahad (honey) abhishek provides a life free of misfortunes and troubles, Panchamrit (mixture of sugar, milk, curd, honey & honey) abhishek provides wealth and prosperity, Ghee (clarified butter) abhishek provides a life free of illness and physical problems & the Dahi (curd) abhishek blesses a child to the childless. <br>

                        As per the Hindu tradition and religious life s greatly influenced by the positioning of the Grahas or planets. According to the Hindu scripture there are nine planets or Grahas (navgraha) influencing our life, the nine Grahs are – Surya (Sun), Chandra (Moon), Mangal (Mars), Budh (Mercury), Brihaspati (Jupiter), Shukra (Venus), Rahu (Uranus), Ketu (Neptune), & Shani (Saturn). <br>
                        The location of planets is connected to the good or terrible moments in a person's life. Unlucky events in one's life are caused by misaligned planets, while fortunate events are caused by well-aligned planets. <br>
                        These Navgraha are the basis of all astrological or horoscope calculations and predictions of a person. It has a huge influence on our lives. It affects our marriage, career, health and finance. The Graha Shanti puja is undertaken to reduce negative effects of the Grahas. <br> 
                        The benefit of Graha Shanti puja are – it reduces the negative energies, purifies the surrounding, prevent unfortunate events and removes obstacles. The puja requires materials such as – turmeric (haldi), camphor, sandalwood, incense sticks, variety of numbers, betel leaves, sweets, betel nuts, kumkum, oil, clarified butter (ghee), ganga jal (water from the Ganges), variety of fruits, honey, Navgraha yantra etc. <br>

One of such tradition is the Vedaparayana or chatur vedparayana, where the mantras (hymns) of all the four Vedas – Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Yajur Veda & Atharva Veda are chanted one by one. Veda is enchanted to create sound. The sound so produced takes different vibrations and frequency and brings the essentials for the earth in the form of rainfall, positivity, peace & prosperity etc. <br>
                        The Vedas calm the mind, balance the human Chakras, increase concentration, bring peace, and reduces stress, increase radiance and prosperity. The benefit of such Vedparayana is numerous for your soul, mind spirit & body. <br>

                    <p>Touring the streets of kashi -
                        If you are visiting kashi and you do not go into the labyrinth of alleys, then you have truly missed seeing the truth that kashi holds and offers. 
                        The first place to visit as per my experience would be the lovely ganges ghat either at dawn or dusk. After that one should visit the great temples of kashi vishwanath, bindumadhav, shakti peeth, sankat mochan etc... Apart from this one should also look into manas mandir, & sarnatn.
                        After a religious outing like the one mentioned above one can take a stroll down the lanes and try local food from famous vendors like - ram bhandar, Kashi chat bhandar, etc.
                        One should also make time to visit banaras hindu university, rajghat fort, the rajghat bridge & the local markets.
                        After all this, the visit should end at the ghat with the arti.</p>

                    <p>
                        In the age old sacred city of kashi, The Sanatan (Hindu) scriptures say that Lord Shiva breathes the sacred Taraka mantra into a dying person's ears. This taraka mantra is a word that is widely and extensively used by the Hindus, but to take effect it has to come from Shiva or Shankar (an entity or a divine person whose name itself signifies the fact that he is the ultimate embodiment of ‘welfare’. Obviously, an entity who is always and wholly concerned with welfare of everyone and everything can take on the responsibility of ‘destruction’ or transformations). 
                        This happens after Kaal Bhairava nullifies the Karma-Vipaka (literally meaning cooked, but actually the matured and culminated results that are borne out of ones actions) of the dying person through Bhairavi yaatanaa (the encapsulated torture of Bhairava, that is intense but is highly compressed in time ).
                        A consciousness or a being so purified and absolved completely of its actions and their results is breathed the Taraka mantra (an understanding that guides in crossing over or transformation) into its ears by none less than the entity that is ultimate in its concerns about welfare of everyone and everything. An event, that transforms the Atman of the being and renders him capable of attaining final salvation. That is why the proclamation that “Death dies here” for KASHI becomes truly potent.

                        Here you will find a number of religious ceremonies being conducted as kashi is the only place where a night out means watching the dashashwamedh ghat arti.
                        Here, the morning starts with a prayer and ends with one. If you wish for spiritual growth or growth in general their is no place like kashi.</p>
